# Graph-theoretic-analysis-of-Smart-Grid
The project has two deliverable: A python module can visualize the dynamic power system into a multicoloured graph and the color can represent that dynamic behaviour. Another python module contains a series of useful metrics are able to capture the collapse based on the changing from the beginning all the way to the collapse.
